This project analyzes the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria. This data was gotten from the NCDC (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control) website.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first confirmed case in Nigeria was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian national in Lagos tested positive for the virus. On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, a Nigerian citizen who came into contact with the Italian national.

As at January 2023, we have 266k confirmed cases, 3458 admitted cases, 260k discharged, 3155 deaths toll with all the states affected. 

From the analysis, we can see Lagos state was affected the most and we can attribute this to various factors such as high population and vibrant nature of the state. Following closely, we have Abuja, Rivers, Kaduna and Oyo, all of which have similar characteristics to Lagos.

Following the outcome of the analysis, I would recommend the citizens should be sensitize more about this virus and how we can contain- take necessary precautions and take the vaccines because there is this misconception that the virus doesn’t exist anymore or didn’t exist at all which isn’t true as there are still active cases recorded as shown in the report.
